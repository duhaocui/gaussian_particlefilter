Gaussian Particle Filter
=======================
Code which uses particle filters to figure out the direction in which
a robot (turtle) moves by generating particles using Gaussian distribution.


Only those particles which move in the same direction as the Robot are
retained, the rest disappear.

*Note* : Direction is symmetric about the X axis.
